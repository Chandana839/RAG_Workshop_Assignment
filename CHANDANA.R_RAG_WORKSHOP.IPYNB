      "\n",
      "üí¨ Answer:\n",
      " Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that focuses on how agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. It's characterized by three main elements, which are essential for understanding the framework (Source Document 1:3). A policy defines \"the learning agent‚Äôs way of behaving at a given time,\" essentially mapping perceived states of the environment to actions that should be taken when in those states (\"roughly speaking, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the envi-\n",
      "ronment to actions to be taken when in those states\"). The value function estimates how good it is for an agent to be in a given state and thus guides decision making. Lastly, some systems include \"a model of the environment\" that predicts outcomes based on current states and actions (Source Document 1:3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Reinforcement learning problems are distinctive because they require closed-loop control without direct instructions for action; instead, agents learn from trial and error within an extended time frame (\"being closed-loop in an essential way\"). The process involves the agent interacting with its environment to achieve a goal by sensing states of the environment and taking actions that affect those states (Source Document 1:3).\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents do not contain specific information regarding currency, money, or dollar within this context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer related to these topics based on the provided texts.

      "üîç Question: What is the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning?\n",
      "\n",
      "üí¨ Answer:\n",
      " The bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning is a fundamental concept that affects model performance. According to \"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\" by Christopher M. Bishop, the bias‚Äìvariance decomposition of an estimator's mean squared error (MSE) can be expressed as:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[ \\text{MSE}(x_0) = \\text{Var}_\\text{T}(\\hat{y}_0) + \\text{\"Bias\"}^2( \\hat{y}_0). \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "This decomposition separates the MSE into two components - variance and squared bias. The source for this information is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Source 1: \"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning,\" by Christopher M. Bishop, which states that \"[the] mean squared error (MSE) of an estimator can be decomposed as follows:\" followed directly below the quote with a citation to the book's page number or chapter where this is discussed in detail:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[ \\text{MSE}(x_0) = E_\\text{T} [f(x_0) - \\hat{y}_0]^2 \\] \n",
      "\\[= \\text{Var}_\\text{T}(\\hat{y}_0) + [\\text{E}_\\text{T}(\\hat{y}_0) - f(x_0)]^2. \\] (Bishop, p.145-146)\n",
      "\n",
      "The bias term represents the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which can be complex and noisy with many parameters, using a simpler model. The variance of an estimator measures how much the estimate would vary if we used different training data sets to train our machine learning algorithm. A high variance indicates that small changes in the training set could result in significant differences in predictions made by the same algorithm on new inputs; this is often due to overfitting, where a model learns noise and details from the training dataset too well but does not generalize it effectively to unseen data (Bishop, p.146).\n",
      "\n",
      "The bias-variance tradeoff suggests that we can reduce either one by increasing or decreasing the complexity of our learning algorithm: reducing variance often increases bias because simpler models are less flexible and may miss relevant relations between features and responses; conversely, lowering bias typically raises variance as more complex models tend to model random noise in the training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source 2 is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from Bishop's discussion on how different learning algorithms balance these two sources of error: \"The best choices for tuning parameters may differ substantially between squared-error loss and zero‚Äìone loss problems.\" (Bishop, p.146)\n",

    "## üß† Objective\n",
    "To build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for answering questions related to Machine Learning from uploaded PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Models Used\n",
    "**Language Model (LLM):** phi3:mini (Ollama)  \n",
    "**Alternative (for low RAM):** mistral:7b-instruct-q4  \n",
    "**Embedding Model:** sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Models?\n",
    "- Lightweight and run locally without cloud APIs.  \n",
    "- Strong balance between accuracy and efficiency.  \n",
    "- Perfect for academic text comprehension tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìö Data\n",
    "Used 5 Machine Learning PDFs covering:\n",
    "- Supervised & Unsupervised Learning  \n",
    "- Reinforcement Learning  \n",
    "- Bias-Variance Tradeoff  \n",
    "- Optimization and Regularization  \n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Retrieval Strategy\n",
    "**Technique:** Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR)  \n",
    "Ensures diverse and relevant context retrieval with parameters:\n",
    "`k=5`, `fetch_k=10`, `lambda_mult=0.7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß© RAG Workflow\n",
    "PDFs ‚Üí Chunking ‚Üí Embeddings (MiniLM) ‚Üí ChromaDB ‚Üí MMR Retriever ‚Üí Ollama LLM ‚Üí Grounded Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Validation\n",
    "- Detects hallucinations and missing citations  \n",
    "- Assigns confidence score (0‚Äì1 scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí¨ Example Query\n",
    "**Q:** What is supervised learning?  \n",
    "**A:** ‚ÄúSupervised learning is a method of training models using labeled data...‚Äù  \n",
    "(Source: ML_1.pdf)  \n",
    "Confidence Score: 0.92 ‚úÖ\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Conclusion\n",
    "This RAG system uses local models and academic PDFs to provide grounded, fact-based answers with source citations.  \n",
    "It demonstrates how RAG pipelines enhance LLM reliability for domain-specific knowledge.\n"
